Description: Instrumental variable (IV) estimators for homogeneous and
    heterogeneous treatment effects with efficient machine learning instruments.
    The estimators are based on double/debiased machine learning allowing for
    nonlinear and potentially high-dimensional control variables. Details can 
    be found in Scheidegger, Guo and BÃ¼hlmann (2025) "Inference for 
    heterogeneous treatment effects with efficient instruments and machine 
    learning" <doi:10.48550/arXiv:2503.03530>.
