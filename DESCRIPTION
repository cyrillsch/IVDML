Description: Instrumental variable (IV) estimators for homogeneous and heterogeneous treatment effects with efficient machine learning instruments. The estimators are based on double/debiased machine learning allowing for nonlinear and potentially high-dimensional control variables. Details can be found in Scheidegger, Guo and Buehlmann (2025) "Inference for heterogeneous treatment effects with efficient instruments and machine learning" <arXiv:2503.03530>.
